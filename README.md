Dataquest project03: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

---

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. It is also to become familiar with some of the unique benefits jupyter notebook provides for pandas.

The main focus of this work is to develop my own understanding of data science and apply what I have learnt so far (on dataquest) to a realistic data analysis application.
